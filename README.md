# Tree-Based DAH Solar Forecast Project

## Overview
The Tree-Based DAH Solar Forecast project is designed for the analysis, training, and forecasting of solar power data using various machine learning models. It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, tuning, accuracy evaluation, and visualization.

## Main Scripts and Their Functions (folder main)
- `accuracy_metrics.R`: Evaluates model performance using various accuracy metrics.
- `create_plots_for_paper.R`: Generates plots and visualizations for research papers or presentations.
- `explore_data.R`: Used for preliminary data analysis and exploration.
- `forecast_rolling_window.R`: Performs rolling window forecasts on solar power data.
- `model_confidence_set.R`: Assesses the confidence levels of different models.
- `shap.R`: Analyzes feature importance using SHAP values.
- `train.R`: Trains models on historical solar power data.
- `tune.R`: Optimizes models by tuning hyperparameters.

## Installation and Setup

First source the file: `"cpp/__init__.R"`

Afterwards:

run `"__init__/install_packages.R"`

Check if all packages are correctly installed
